          When Iâ€™m not busy designing or coding, youâ€™ll usually find me with my
          head in a <strong>book</strong> â€” Iâ€™m equally into{" "}
          <em>
            non-fiction, educational deep dives, and the occasional guilty
            pleasure read
          </em>
          . ðŸ“š
        </p>

        <p>
          Iâ€™m also what you could call a <strong>water enthusiast</strong>. ðŸŒŠ
          Oceans, lakes, rivers, swimming pools, spa & wellness centers â€” if it
          involves water, Iâ€™m there. Swimming is my ultimate reset button.
        </p>

        <p>
          Traveling and <strong>group activities</strong> keep me energized. I
          love{" "}
          <em>
            team buildings, interactive trainings, and collecting new
            certificates
          </em>
          . For me, learning should always be a mix of fun, collaboration, and a
          little adventure.

          Since the age of <strong>16</strong>, Iâ€™ve been working alongside my
          studies to support myself. Itâ€™s taught me{" "}
          <strong>responsibility, work ethic, and resilience</strong> â€” and that
          coffee is, in fact, a food group. â˜•
        </p>

        <p>
          I thrive most in places where thereâ€™s a real sense of{" "}
          <strong>togetherness</strong> â€” openness, honesty, and teamwork that
          goes beyond the buzzwords. Environments where people genuinely support
          one another are where I do my best work.
        </p>

          And yes, I know itâ€™s <em>a bit early</em> to apply â€” Iâ€™d officially
          join in <strong>February next year</strong>. But Iâ€™m not a last-minute
          person. Iâ€™d rather{" "}
          <strong>
            secure my internship spot early, tick it off my to-do list
          </strong>
          , and then focus on showing up prepared and motivated when the time
          comes.
