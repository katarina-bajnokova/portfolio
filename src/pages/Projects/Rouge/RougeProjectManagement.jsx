      <h2>Project Management</h2>
      <p>
        One of my goals for this project was not only to deliver a functioning
        app, but also to treat the semester like a{" "}
        <strong>real-world software development cycle</strong>. To achieve this,
        we set up a dedicated <strong>Notion workspace</strong> and managed the
        entire project with Agile and Lean techniques. This approach helped us
        plan effectively, stay on track, and keep documentation transparent for
        both team members.
      </p>
      <p>
        The entire workspace with full documentation can be explored here:{" "}

      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        At the start, we defined our{" "}
        <strong>team roles, technology stack, and process</strong>. We agreed on
        working in <strong>8 sprints (one per week)</strong>, supported by a{" "}
        <strong>Kanban board</strong> for tracking. This structure gave us
        clarity, accountability, and the ability to split a large project into
        smaller, achievable goals. Setting this up mirrored the workflows I will
        face in a professional development team.
      </p>

      <h3>Meetings & Communication</h3>
      <p>
        To stay aligned, we ran <strong>weekly meetings</strong> and{" "}
        <strong>daily stand-ups</strong>. Every meeting was logged in Notion,
        with priorities, attendees, and key decisions. This documentation acted
        like a professional project log, which is especially valuable when
        multiple developers collaborate. It ensured that no detail was lost and
        everyone was accountable for their tasks.
      </p>
      <img src={PM2} alt="Project Meetings Screenshot" className="pm-image" />

      <h3>Sprint Planning</h3>
      <p>
        We divided the semester into <strong>8 sprints</strong>, each with
        defined goals, deliverables, and deadlines. Instead of rushing toward
        the end, this iterative approach allowed us to{" "}
        <strong>continuously deliver usable features</strong>. By the end of
        each sprint, we could showcase tangible progress (UI screens, functional
        APIs, or database updates).
      </p>
      <img src={PM3} alt="Sprints Overview Screenshot" className="pm-image" />

      <h3>Example Sprint Board</h3>
      <p>
        Each sprint board followed a clear structure:{" "}
        <em>Not Started â†’ In Progress â†’ Completed</em>. Tasks were assigned to
        either Andrea or me, and we used standups to update the status daily.
        This gave us full visibility of project health. For example, in{" "}
        <strong>Sprint 1</strong>, I set up the React and PHP environments,
        connected the repositories, and handled technical setup, while Andrea
        focused on UI styling and testing component libraries.
      </p>
      <img src={PM4} alt="Sprint 1 Board Screenshot" className="pm-image" />

      <h3>Collaboration & Role Sharing</h3>
      <p>
        Although Andrea and I shared many responsibilities, we also divided our
        focus areas to play to our strengths while ensuring we both gained{" "}
        <strong>full-stack experience</strong>.
