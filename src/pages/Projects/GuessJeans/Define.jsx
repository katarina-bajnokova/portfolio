        <h2>Define – Turning Insights into Clarity</h2>
        <p>
          In the <strong>Define phase</strong>, I transformed raw empathy into{" "}
          <strong>structured design direction</strong>. While the empathize
          stage revealed the emotional highs and lows of shopping for denim, the
          define stage was about framing those needs into{" "}
          <em>
            clear problem statements, testable hypotheses, and strong value
            propositions
          </em>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked with several personas, but here I’m showcasing{" "}
          <strong>Ema – The Bold Refiner</strong>, as she represents a critical
          yet often overlooked user group: women with curvier body shapes who
          want denim that celebrates, not compromises, their identity.

        <h3>Step 1 – Ema’s Context</h3>
        <div className="highlight-box">
          <p>
            <strong>Who:</strong> Ema, a 29-year-old boutique owner curating
            bold, body-positive fashion.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What:</strong> Needs jeans that fit hips and waist without
            gaping, while reflecting her unapologetic style.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Where:</strong> Shops mainly online but feels disconnected
            by models and sizing guides that don’t represent her.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>When:</strong> Frustrated most when preparing for events or
            curating boutique collections.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Why:</strong> Mainstream brands rarely design for curvier
            women, leaving her excluded and forced to compromise.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How:</strong> Relies on sizing charts, reviews, and return
            policies before buying.

      {/* PROBLEM STATEMENT */}
      <section className="project-section">
        <h3>Step 2 – Problem Statement</h3>
        <blockquote>
          Ema is a bold, fashion-forward shopper who needs denim designed for
          curvier proportions and authentic representation in campaigns, because
          mainstream brands leave her excluded with poor fit and lack of
          inclusivity.

      {/* HYPOTHESES */}
      <section className="project-section">
        <h3>Step 3 – Hypotheses</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>If</strong> denim brands account for waist-to-hip ratios,{" "}
            <strong>then</strong> Ema will finally find jeans that fit without
            gaping or squeezing.
            <br />
            <em>
              Adding detailed fit guides (with visuals for curvier bodies) will
              boost her confidence before purchase.
            </em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>If</strong> campaigns showcase diverse, body-positive
            models, <strong>then</strong> Ema will feel represented and more
            motivated to buy.
            <br />
            <em>
              Inclusive product photography will reduce hesitation and build
              brand trust.
            </em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>If</strong> jean collections are grouped by style and
            occasion, <strong>then</strong> Ema will easily connect pieces with
            her bold personal style.
            <br />
            <em>
              Curated “style stories” will save her time and reinforce her
              identity as a bold fashion curator.

          <p>
            Our denim experience ensures women like Ema can find jeans designed

        <h4>Why This Phase Was Important</h4>
        <p>
          The Define phase was the <strong>bridge</strong> between empathy and
          ideation. It turned scattered insights into{" "}
          <em>problem statements, testable hypotheses, and value promises</em>{" "}
          that anchored the design direction in real user needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          In short, it ensured every design choice was rooted in{" "}
          <strong>confidence, inclusivity, and clarity</strong>—the pillars that
          shaped the rest of the project.
