      <h2>About Koyekola</h2>

      <p>
        Koyekola is my personal project, created to make learning{" "}
        <strong>Lingala fun and accessible for children</strong> through games
        and interactive tools. It started with brand development, logo, and a
        playful identity, and then expanded into a{" "}
        <strong>React + Sass landing page</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The idea first came to me when I wanted to learn Lingala at home.
        Unfortunately, I quickly realized that{" "}
        <strong>there are very few correct study materials available</strong>.
        Interactive games simply do not exist, interactive apps are not
        available, and books or exercise books are{" "}
        <strong>extremely limited in both availability and quality</strong>.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Children living abroad grow up without easy access to their own language
        and heritage online.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        That reflection pushed me to go beyond simply creating a website. I
        decided to create a{" "}
        <strong>complete brand and long-term educational ecosystem</strong>: a
        company that would include a learning website, interactive games for
        Lingala, coloring books, and exercise books — with the vision of
        expanding into more products and experiences in the future.

        <h4>Current Phase</h4>
        <p>
          I am still in the <strong>research and empathize phase</strong>. Since
          this is a personal project, I want to take the necessary time to{" "}
          <strong>
            analyze the problem space deeply and understand the real needs of
            the community
          </strong>
          , instead of diving in headlessly.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        I also recognize that it might not be the smartest decision to include
        something unfinished in my portfolio. However,{" "}
        <strong>this project is very close to my heart</strong> and carries
        personal meaning. For me, it is important to remain{" "}
        <em>grounded, correct, and helpful</em> — even in a world that often
        feels rushed. I value doing work that is{" "}
        <strong>genuinely meaningful and impactful</strong>, rather than only
        chasing speed or trends.

        <h4>Why It Matters</h4>
        <p>
          Koyekola represents my ability to{" "}
          <strong>
            design, brand, and code a digital product from scratch
          </strong>
          , but more importantly, it reflects my passion for{" "}
          <em>
            building meaningful tools that preserve culture and empower the next
            generation
          </em>
          .
